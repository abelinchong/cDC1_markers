This code has two files, one named GSE122108 and the other is GSE109125. They both have the same steps for RNAseq filtering. The aim of the code is to generate a Heatmap in which we can filter specific and highly expressed surface genes in cDC1 for targeting. They start with a library of packages used in the functions of each file. Te code is intended to run on R.
